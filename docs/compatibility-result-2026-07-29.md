# rutomq compatibility result — 2026-07-29

## Result

**PASS for the compatibility envelope described below.**

This checkpoint records the current implementation as a dated result. It
means that the listed protocol surface, clients, storage path, failure cases,
and deployment scenarios passed together against the same source workspace.
It does not claim complete semantic parity with every Apache Kafka deployment
or every possible client configuration.

The API-by-API contract remains the source of truth for exact versions and
behavior: [Kafka compatibility matrix](compatibility.md).

## Snapshot

| Item | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Wire baseline | Types generated from the official Kafka 4.3.0 schemas through `kafka-protocol 0.17.0-kafka.4.3.0` |
| Advertised surface | 74 API keys; `ApiVersions` advertises only handled versions, apart from Kafka 4.3's required Produce 0-13 negotiation range while removed Produce v0-v2 remain rejected |
| Backward compatibility | Kafka Java 3.9.1 AdminClient, Kafka Java 4.2.0 clients, librdkafka 2.15.0, and franz-go 1.21.5 passed |
| Flink | Flink 2.2.1 with Kafka connector 5.0.0-2.2 passed source, sink, checkpoint-offset recovery, and exact resume |
| Kafka Streams | Kafka Streams 4.2.0 passed classic and Streams group protocols, `exactly_once_v2`, state restore, repartition, and standby promotion |
| Persistence | PostgreSQL metadata plus immutable OpenDAL S3/MinIO objects; no Agent-local WAL, PVC, or data volume |
| Acknowledgement boundary | Produce succeeds only after object storage succeeds and the PostgreSQL metadata transaction commits |
| Deployment | Stateless multi-Agent and Helm/Kubernetes rolling replacement plus scale-out/scale-in passed |

## Validated functionality

| Area | Current result |
| --- | --- |
| Produce and Fetch | Idempotent production, compression, timestamp and record validation, immutable object batching, exact range fetch, checksum verification, sparse offsets, fetch sessions, `read_committed`, and `read_uncommitted` passed |
| Consumer groups | Classic groups and the Kafka 4 consumer protocol passed membership, static membership, rebalances, offset recovery, assignment epochs, response-loss recovery, and PostgreSQL-backed coordinator replacement |
| Group conversion and assignment | Empty classic and consumer-protocol groups convert in both directions while preserving offsets and GROUP config; consumer assignors are `uniform` and `range`; the share assignor is `simple` |
| Regex subscriptions | The 10-second metadata guard and configurable maximum regex refresh interval passed paused-time, PostgreSQL reconnect, cross-Agent, and full-client validation |
| Share groups | Share membership, acquire/acknowledge/release/redelivery, duration reset, lag, Admin APIs, and share coordinator state APIs passed |
| Transactions | Idempotent retry, commit/abort, transactional offset commits, fencing, KIP-939 two-phase recovery, KIP-1228 marker epochs, expiry, and `read_committed` visibility passed |
| Admin and configuration | Topic lifecycle, partitions, configs, ACLs, quotas, telemetry, logical feature metadata, virtual log directories, leader/reassignment compatibility, and SCRAM administration passed |
| Security | TLS, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512, delegation-token authentication, Topic/Group/Cluster/TransactionalId ACLs, and authorization filtering passed with Kafka 4.3.1 clients |
| Stateless durability | Three Agents passed ambiguous acknowledgement retry, SIGKILL/restart, S3 outage, PostgreSQL commit failure, orphan GC, retention deletion recovery, and exact object/span convergence |
| Kubernetes | A stable Service retained 1,600 unique records at contiguous offsets through an image rollout and replica changes `3 -> 5 -> 2`, with zero Agent PVCs |

## Explicit compatibility boundaries

- Non-empty classic-to-consumer or consumer-to-classic online migration is not
  implemented or advertised. Mixed-protocol rolling membership remains
  outside this result.
- Server-side assignors are the implemented Rust-native choices only:
  consumer `uniform`/`range` and share `simple`. Java assignor classes or
  arbitrary assignor plugins are not loaded by the Agent.
- The topology is one logical Kafka cluster with a virtual broker,
  controller, leader, and ISR member. APIs that require physical replica logs,
  follower reads, local log directories, or real KRaft controller state are
  virtualized, constrained to the one-broker model, or omitted as documented
  in the API matrix.
- PostgreSQL and S3-compatible object storage are required for durable
  progress. If either durable dependency is unavailable, Produce is not
  acknowledged and the client must retry.
- This result does not include a UI, cross-region replication, a Schema
  Registry service, Kafka Connect management, a Kubernetes Operator, or
  multi-virtual-cluster isolation.
- Unknown or future API versions are rejected with Kafka protocol errors; they
  are not treated as successful compatibility.

## Validation evidence

All commands exited successfully in OrbStack, using Rust 1.88 and a fresh
PostgreSQL database named `rutomq_packet270_20260729`.

| Gate | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Rust workspace | Formatting, strict all-target/all-feature Clippy, all workspace tests, fresh PostgreSQL integrations, and release build passed |
| OpenDAL/MinIO | Multipart immutable write, cross-part range, replacement rejection, cross-Agent read, and a 10+ MiB Kafka object fetch passed |
| Retention | Shared-object safety, durable deletion retry, replacement-Agent recovery, and zero remaining objects passed |
| Native clients | librdkafka 2.15.0 and franz-go 1.21.5 acceptance passed |
| Flink/Java/Streams | Flink 2.2.1, Kafka connector 5.0.0-2.2, Java Kafka 4.2.0, Kafka Streams 4.2.0, and Kafka 3.9.1 AdminClient acceptance passed |
| Security | Kafka 4.3.1 TLS/SCRAM/ACL/delegation-token acceptance passed |
| Multi-Agent | 900 unique records at contiguous offsets, 378 committed objects, format-v1 integrity, and zero orphan objects passed |
| Kubernetes | 1,600 unique records at contiguous offsets across rollout and scaling, with zero PVCs, passed |

The executable acceptance gates are kept under `tests/`; each
`run-orbstack.sh` entry point recreates its isolated dependencies and
assertions.

## Conclusion

The current workspace is a validated Kafka-compatible, stateless,
object-storage-backed broker for the tested client and deployment envelope.
Flink runs correctly within that envelope. The explicit boundaries above are
part of the result; this checkpoint should not be described as complete Kafka
semantic parity.
